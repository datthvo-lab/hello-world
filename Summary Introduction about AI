Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is an augmented intelligence aiming to extend human capabilities and tackle tasks beyond human and machine capabilities.

Machine learning models are developed through supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

AI can be divided based on its strengths: 

Weak (narrow) AI: Specific domains 

Strong (generalized) AI: Diverse capabilities across unrelated tasks

Super AI: Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all domains.   

Generative AI
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can generate content across various media, such as written texts, images, audio, or videos.

Large language models (LLMs) are advanced neural network architectures for processing and generating human-like text.

The capabilities of generative AI include diverse content creation capabilities, human-like capabilities, and data augmentation.

Domain-specific use cases of generative AI are:

Marketing

Creative

Product development

Industry-specific use cases of generative AI are: 

Healthcare

Gaming

Fashion

Education and training

Benefits of AI
Virtual assistants and smart home devices use AI to automate routine tasks, making our lives efficient and convenient. 

AI uses a recommendation system to provide personalized suggestions across various streaming, social media, and e-commerce platforms.

AI boosts security and safeguards us against potential threats via biometric authentication and fraud detection.

AI’s integration into smart devices enhances user experience and functionality.

Generative AI Use Cases
Various LLMs, such as GPT, PaLM, and Gemini, are used for text generation. Tools such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini are based on such large language models.

Generative AI also helps with image generation using advanced models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E.

Generative AI enhances voice and music generation, creating genres and moods with tools like Murf and AIVA.

Generative AI algorithms can create lifelike videos and models like Google’s Imagen Video and OpenAI’s Sora.

AI Chatbots and Smart Assistants
AI chatbots and smart assistants are AI-driven software programs that understand and respond to queries, provide information, and perform tasks. 

Chatbots have evolved from simple rule-based systems to AI-powered personal assistants and generative AI chatbots that are capable of complete conversations.

Chatbots' benefits include 24/7 availability, scalability, personalized services and suggestions, natural conversations, and multilingual communication.

Applications of AI chatbots span across industries, including customer service, e-commerce, healthcare, and education. It involves more human-like interactions, sentiment analysis, automated HR and IT support tasks, and handling processes like refunds.
